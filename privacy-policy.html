                        We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as
                        follows:
                        <br><br>
                        Service providers. We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide
                        services to our shop, such as delivery companies. We will share your personal information with
                        these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.

                        requests; (b) enforce my agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address
                        fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights,
                        property, and safety of my customers, or others.

                        We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to provide you with our
                        services and as described in my Privacy Policy. However, we may also be required to retain this

                        other jurisdictions. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to a jurisdiction
                        with different data protection and government surveillance laws than your jurisdiction. If we
                        are deemed to transfer information about you outside of the EU, we rely on Privacy Shield as the
